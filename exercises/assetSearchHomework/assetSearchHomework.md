# Asset Scavenger Hunt

You will work with your group to collect assets that can be used for a rapid prototype of a game idea. You will complete this as if you were working at a game studio, which means you can not clam "Fair Use" to use any assets, with no budget. You will need to use what we talked about IP rights in class to find assets that you are legaly allowed to use.

## Asset List

1.  Main Character
2.  Enemy Character
3.  Projectile
4.  Background Soundtrack
5.  Hit Soundeffect
6.  Fire Soundeffect
