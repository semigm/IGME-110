# Accessibility Exercise (Week 10, Thursday)

## Overview & Goals

For this exercise you are going to evaluate pages from two different websites, using the web-based version of [WebAIM's Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](http://wave.webaim.org/) or the [WebAIM WAVE Chrome Extension](http://wave.webaim.org/extension/) Keeping in mind the key issues discussed in the readings for today (Thursday, 10/31).

## Accessibility Evaluation

Choose two different websites, and run a page from each through the accessibility evaluator. In a document, provide the URL for the page that you reviewed, and answer the following questions: What problems did it spot? How much of an impact could those problems have on a user with accessibility issues? How could those problems be addressed? (If the page you chose has no accessibility issues, find another one!)

## Deliverable
Before noon on Saturday (11/02), upload the document to the Dropbox in myCourses.
