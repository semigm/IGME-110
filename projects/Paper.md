# Research Paper

In this assignment, you will select a topic related to interactive media, identify or formulate what effect it has had, find supporting evidence for your argument, and write a 5-7 page paper on the topic. 

Here are some examples of the types of arguments you could make:
- "Photoshop is the most important tool for interactive designers to learn." 
- "[Book/Movie Title] was hugely influential in the development of XXX media." 
- "[Technology Type] will be the next big thing in interactive media." 

 Be sure to select an appropriate topic; one where you can find sufficient resources--online and/or offline--and, ideally. If you're having trouble thinking of a suitable topic, feel free to contact me for help.

Write the paper in your own words. Any external sources that you quote should be clearly attributed. If you plagiarize any of the paper, you will fail not only this assignment, but the entire course. We'll be talking about what does and does not constitute plagiarism in class. 
  
Be creative, and (despite what you may have been told in high school) don't be afraid to be personal. You do not need to write a highly formal paper. Writing in the first person is encouraged. Explain why you chose this topic--what meaning and importance does it have for you? What did you find out in doing your research that you didn't know before? Don't just summarize the facts that you find...that increases your risk of plagiarism, and decreases your chances of a high grade. Instead, do the research, then put the books and printouts away, and think about how you'd explain to your best friend or your parent what's important or compelling about the topic you've chosen. Make me care about the topic. 

You must, however, support your opinions and assertions with citations to valid external sources. You should provide the source for any quotations or factual information (even if it's not a quotation) that you include in your paper. Your bibliography must include a *minimum* of eight sources, with at least four of those sources being edited, respected sources (books, journals, magazines, newspapers, well-edited websites). You may not use reference/tertiary sources (such as encyclopedias or dictionaries)--while it's fine to use them for your research, you should check the original sources they draw from, and use those for your citations. When in doubt about a source, ask me! You will also need to provide a brief (no more than one paragraph) annotation for each reference, explaining how it was useful for your paper.

## Deliverables

### Topic Idea: Due by 11:59pm on Monday, 09/02/2019 23rd
A very basic statement of your topic and a brief description or outline of your approach to the paper need to be turned on myCourses. This is not a graded assignment, but if you do not turn it in, you'll lose 15% off your final paper grade. 

### First Draft: Uploaded to Google Drive by TBD
At a *minimum*, the draft should include an introductory paragraph, and a full outline of your intended content. The more you include, however, the more useful the feedback you get will be. You must review and comment on all of your group members' drafts before Friday afternoon. This is a good way to see examples of other students' approaches to the assignment, as well as to get peer feedback before turning in your final paper. Again, while the assignment will not be graded, if you don't upload a draft **and** participate in the peer review  you'll lose 15% of your final paper grade.

### Final Paper: Due before midnight on Sunday, TBD
Upload an electronic copy of the paper in the myCourses  dropbox. It must be in Word (.doc, .docx), rich text format (.rtf), PDF (.pdf), or Open Office (.odf). Please do not submit it in Apple Pages or any other non-standard format, and do not simply submit a link to a Google Doc. Most word processing programs (including Google Docs and Apple Pages) will allow you to save a file in PDF or RTF format.  

Here are the content and formatting requirements for the paper: 
  	
  - The minimum length for the body of the paper (not including the title page, abstract, or bibliographic references) is 1200 words. There is not a maximum length cutoff, but I would prefer that the paper not exceed 2,500 words. 
  - You must use a style manual to format your paper, footnotes/endnotes, and bibliography. You can use whichever standard style you'd like--APA, MLA, Chicago, Turabian, etc. For more information on style manuals and citing sources, consult the RIT Library style guide references at http://infoguides.rit.edu/citationguide, come to my office hours, or talk to a librarian at the Wallace Library. 
  - Include a bibliography of all articles, books, and online resources you use to research your topic. This bibliography should include any reference that you cite in your paper. Use your chosen style manual's format for your bibliographic references. 
  - You must include at least eight references in your bibliography, and a minimum of four of those references should be to high-quality edited sources--books, magazine or journal articles, or newspaper articles, all properly cited. The other four sources can be (but do not have to be) more informal web-based sources. You *may not* count reference books or websites such as encyclopedias or dictionaries (tertiary sources) towards your eight references. 
  - All bibliography entries should include a brief annotation describing the nature of the work and how it was relevant to your paper.
  - Proofread and edit your writing. Spelling and grammatical errors will count against your grade.
