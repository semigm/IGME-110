# Practice Bibliography Exercise

Begin by choosing one of the following topics (do *not* use your own research paper topic):

- Virtual Reality
- Augmented Reality
- Laurie Anderson
- Hiroshi Ishii
- Adobe Systems, Inc.


1. Create a new project in [NoodleTools](http://ezproxy.rit.edu/login?url=http://www.noodletools.com/login.php?group=1370&code=1058), using the APA citation style, and a citation level of Advanced. You can give it whatever name you’d like. When the project loads, switch to the Sources tab--that's the only section you'll need for this exercise.

2. Using the resources discussed in class the readings from this week's readings, look for materials that might be appropriate for a paper on this topic. You should identify at least four sources that come from high-quality edited or curated sources--books, magazines, journals, academic conference proceedings, newspapers, or reputable edited websites. ([Library databases](http://infoguides.rit.edu/c.php?g=332548&p=2234486) and/or [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/) are your best sources for these.) The other four can come from any source, including blogs, forum posts, marketing materials, personal websites, and even emails or social media posts. 

3. Enter each of the relevant sources you find into the Sources section of your NoodleTools project, making sure you include all relevant information (author, even if it's an organizational author, publication date, URL, etc). For each source, you should also include a 1-2 sentence summary of what the source includes and why you included it. (e.g. "This article provides a detailed discography of works by the artist, and was published by a well-respected industry website." 

4. When you have eight references, with at least four of those being from edited or curated sources, use the "Print/Export" button at the top of the citation list to export it as a Word document (.docx or .doc), and upload that document to the dropbox in myCourses. The finished bibliography should be submitted to the myCourses Dropbox no later than 8am on Monday, September 10.
