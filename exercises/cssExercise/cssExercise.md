# CSS Exercise (Week 7, Thursday 10/10)

Today's exercise is to create two simple HTML pages and a CSS stylesheet, using what you've learned about HTML and CSS thus far, both in your readings and in lecture. 

## Instructions

Create two HTML pages that use the same linked style sheet. Each should include a title, an image, at least two paragraphs of text, and a link to the other page. 

At a minimum, do the following using CSS rules:  

1. Apply at least one (but no more than two) [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to your content, as demonstrated in lecture. (Reminder: from the Google Fonts page, click the red plus sign next to a font name to select it. Then click on the "family/families selected" bar at the bottom of the screen. Add the "link" code to the head of your HTML document; you can then use the font family name in your CSS.)
2. Format your image by setting its maximum width, assigning a float:left or float:right property to allow text to wrap around it, and adding margins and/or padding to provide appropriate spacing.
4. Change the default linespacing on the page from the default of 1em to 1.1em. 

 
## Deliverables

Put the two HTML pages, the CSS file, and your image files into a folder. Zip the folder, and upload it to the myCourses Assignments dropbox no later than noon on Saturday.
