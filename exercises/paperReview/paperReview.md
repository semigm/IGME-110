# First Draft Peer Review

Today you will be picking two of your group members' papers to review, using a review form based on the paper grading rubric.

## Part 1: Download and Name the Peer Review Form

Inside of your Google Shared Drive you will find a folder "Paper", in there you will find two files. The first is a spreadsheet, First Draft Peer Reviews, that you will use to make sure everyone gets their paper review by only 2 people. Please put your name in the first column "Writer's Name" and then put your name as "Review 1" and "Reviwer 2" (not for the same person).

The second document, Paper Peer Eval, is the word doc you will use for the peer review. Make a copy for each of the papers you will review. File -> Make a copy

Right-click on the following link, and save the file to your computer: (PaperPeerEval.docx)

Once you've downloaded it, make a second copy. Name each of the files using your name and the name of the person whose paper you're reviewing. For example, if Professor Lawley was reviewing Emily Turner's paper, she'd name the file "Lawley-Turner.docx".

## Part 2: Review the Papers

Each of your group members has an individual folder inside your group's notes folder, which is where you'll find the paper to review.

For each paper, answer the questions on the review form. The questions are drawn from the rubric we'll use to grade the final versions of the papers. Please be constructive when evaluating the papers; focus on suggestions for improvement, rather than simply criticisms of the content.

Upload your finished review to the Google Drive folder containing the paper.

## Deliverables

**Before you leave class today**, you should have completed both peer review forms, and uploaded them to the paper author's folder in Google Drive.
