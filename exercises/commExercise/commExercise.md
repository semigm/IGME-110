# Week 1 Thursday Exercise: Google Drive and Discord Collaboration

1.  Log into RIT's Google Apps site (<http://google.rit.edu>), go to the Drive section, and select the "Shared With Me" option in the left sidebar. You should see a folder for your group (e.g. "IGME.110.2019 Group X"). If you don't see it, let the Professor know that there's a problem.

2.  Right-click the group folder, and from the drop-down menu choose "Add to My Drive". (You may also want to "Star" the folder to make it easier to find, since Google Drive can become filled with a large number of things.)

3.  Open the "Week 01 Notes" document inside the folder, and add some notes from this week's lectures. If other members of your group have already entered notes, you don't need to replicate them--instead, you can add to them, edit them, format them, etc. There doesn't need to be a lot of content, but when we look at the version history for the file (File->Version History->See version history), we should see some evidence of meaningful partcipation by you.

4.  In a different browser tab, open the class Discord. (_You can also do this from the desktop/mobile app_)

5.  Find your group's private channel; it should show up in the channel list on the left side. If you don't see a private channel with your group's number, it's because we couldn't find you on Discord when they were set up; ask the Professor to add you now.

6.  Configure your Discord notifications. ([How do I mute and disable notifications for specific channels?](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/209791877-How-do-I-mute-and-disable-notifications-for-specific-channels-)) You can change the overall settings for the Discord, and then you can override the global settings on a channel-by-channel basis. What I generally do is turn on all notifications for the class, and then mute individual channels, like #github-updates or #memes-n-stuff. You're welcome to set it up in whatever way works best for you. (However, since the #announcements channel is used only by the professor and TA for class-wide announcements, it's probably a bad idea to mute that channel!)

**_If you have an iOS or Android mobile device, I highly recommend installing the Discord app so that you don't have to be in front of a computer to get notifications!_**
